                <h5 id="subtitle">Objective:</h5>
                <p>Automate the process of piloting a drone through an obstacle course. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <h5 id="subtitle">Method:</h5>
                <p>We were separated into teams of four with revolving roles. The "Controller" was responsible for plotting a course through the obstacle course using a controller, while another team member was tasked with retrieving the drone if it fell. The third position, "Manager," involved facilitating communication among team members. The final position was "Programmer," which I initially filled. We only had a brief time in each position, but my contributions laid the groundwork for our team's success.</p>
                <p> To begin, I outlined potential functions we would require, such as "flying through hoops" and "landing." From there, my team seamlessly fleshed out the functionalities. It was rewarding to learn that our careful code organization was recognized as the key to our victory at the award ceremony.</p>

                <p>“With the rapid advancement of technology, it is important to use its power in ways that benefit society. HackDavis challenges its participants to create for social good and create an opportunity for us to explore the intersection between technology and society.”  (https://hackdavis.io/)</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h5 id="subtitle">Method:</h5>
                <p>For this project my team developed an interactive website that utilizes a machine learning algorithm to generate images for children’s short stories. Our personal goal was to provide K-12 students with a tool that encouraged learning and sparked creativity, ultimately enhancing their educational experience.</p>
